# Logic Exercises in Python

This repository contains a collection of logic and algorithm exercises designed to share with the community and help take our programming skills to the next level.

## Content

In these exercises, you will find fundamental and advanced programming concepts such as:

- Recursion
- Linear and binary searches
- Sorting algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort
- Applied recursion
- Permutations and combinatorics
- Dynamic programming (DP)
- And much more

## Description

Each exercise includes a detailed statement and a proposed solution, developed entirely from scratch in Python. The goal is for you to understand the problem, the method to solve it, and the practical implementation of the algorithm.

## Usage

1. Explore the exercises by topic or difficulty.
2. Read the problem statement carefully.
3. Try to solve the problem before reviewing the solution.
4. Review the solution to compare, learn new techniques, or improve your code.

## Why this repository?

Practicing these exercises will help you:

- Improve programming logic.
- Understand and apply classic and modern algorithms.
- Prepare for technical interviews or competitive programming challenges.
- Consolidate fundamental concepts in Python and algorithms.
